## Overview

The current implementation is simple yet effective, performing the required functionality as expected.

- The app follows the **MVVM architecture**, ensuring clean separation of concerns and minimizing unnecessary API calls to optimize performance.

## Areas for Improvement

While the app works well, several enhancements can be made to improve both performance and user experience:

- **UI Enhancements**: Incorporating elements like a progress bar and a refresh button for a better user experience.
- **Coroutine Integration**: Implementing coroutines for more efficient management of background tasks and asynchronous operations.

Despite these potential improvements, the app functions smoothly and produces the desired results. Error handling has been implemented thoroughly to cover as many scenarios as possible.

## Testing

I have thoroughly tested the API, and you can find the test cases in the `unittest/fetchitem.test` file.

## Sorting Logic

Regarding sorting, the `name` field is a string, so directly sorting it would lead to incorrect ordering (e.g., "28" would appear before "276"). To address this, I split the name field, converted the second element to an integer, and then applied the sorting logic accordingly.
